Advanced-Youtube-Downloader
===========================

Why another Youtube downloader? Aren't there enough already?
Well, there might be. But since none of them fitted my needs, I created this one.

# Features

- Relies on FFMPEG.exe and youtube-dl.exe and thus can easily be updated to support new websites and formats.
- Support single video links as well as different playlists.
- Automatically removes silence from the videos.
- Automatically normalizes the audio volume.
- Automatically searches the Gracenote Music DB for song information. The user can then change the information and write it into the file.
- The album-art is automatically downloaded and included.
