Advanced-Youtube-Downloader
===========================

Why another Youtube downloader? Aren't there enough already?
Well, there might be. But since none of them fitted my needs, I created this one.

# Where do I get a runnable version?
Head over to the releases page at https://github.com/Zahlii/Advanced-Youtube-Downloader/releases.

# Features

- **One-Click download of playlists and videos** from more than **150 websites**.
- **Removes silent parts** of the video.
- Can run peak normalization or use **ReplayGain** to adjust the audio volume.
- **Conversion to MP3** is done automatically.
- Retrieves **Meta-Information and Album-Artwork from GracenoteMusicDB**
- Fully customizable with settings for audio bitrate and naming conventions.
- Uses external, community-driven products such as ffmpeg, youtube-dl and mp3gain which allows for easy update checking.
